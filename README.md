# DatLat
Stands for data lattice; it's a class that is basically a very overengineered... array.

I wrote a small script for personal testing in raw HTML, CSS and JS. Run `index.html` to have a look.

## ...Why?
I was getting comfortable with algorithmic thinking and thought myself very smart for using recursion to build and search through an array :')

It also helped me get familiar with Javascript's prototype system.

I wanted to make an array class because I found multidimensional array syntax kinda tough at the time...yes it doesn't make sense in retrospect but I was starting out :)

## DatLatGE
This lead to my attempt to make a small 2d game engine which is in another repo.
